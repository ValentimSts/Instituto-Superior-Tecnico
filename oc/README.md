## Lab1
Memory Hierarchy:
 - A project using DineroIV. Analyze the simulator's cache and determine the best setup/charachteristics for it (cache size, block size, policies, number of ways, ...).

## Lab2
System Modeling and Profiling:
 - A series of small C programs designed to analyze the computer's cache, with the PAPI library. Forces multiple misses on the cache and by analyzing the miss times and miss rates we determine its characteristics (cache size, block size, number of ways, ...).

## Lab3
Instruction Level Parallelism:
 - A pipeline simulation analysis of multiple assembly programs, each one being an improvement of the previous, using multiple techniques such as: data forwarding, instruction re-ordering, loop unrolling and usage of the branch delay slot.
